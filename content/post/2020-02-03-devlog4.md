# Devlog 4: Science and Technology Museum Visit

•	This week we went to the Science and Technology Museum, here they showed us the Survey Markers that the potential group would be working with. 

•	I had never been to the Science and Tech Museum before, it was an interesting layout in the actual Museum part, very open and what looked to be interactive. I wonder how the function and mobility that is included in this Museum was brainstormed and how the process of layout goes into displaying information. 

•	I know that this museum is in the middle of renovations and moving all their collections and recourses into their new building. While we were there, they mentioned that they are still finding new articles that are a part of the collections. 

•	I hope that the group that ends up working with them will aid in helping explore different digital avenues that they can explore in the future with all of the new collections that they have.

•	I think that with this being the final museum, I am pretty confident with my decision to be a part of the Nature Museum group.
