# Devlog 7: Meeting with the Prof

•	Today we all sat down with Professor Graham to flesh out the way we are approaching our project. 

•	I think that the meeting was successful, and it definitely put to rest some of my anxieties over the workload that we had set ourselves.

•	We decided to create a model of the data first – sketch it out. This was we can really flesh out our own process. 

•	We changed our original approach. We have decided to abandon the corresponding cards associated with the catalogue. 

•	It is more work than is absolutely necessary and, to ensure that our project will be up and running for the beginning of April, we decided this was the best decision. 

•	Our focus has now shifted solely to the Catalogue of specimens found on the archeological site.  

•	Our plan is now to go back to the Museum and take pictures of all of the pages for the Catalogue so that we can plug them into Azure, which will then be able to recognize all the writing within the catalogue. 

•	This allows us to work at a faster pace and ensure just makes accessing the data easier. 

•	We will then put in all the data that Azure gives us into an Excel spreadsheet and clean it up so that it is more legible.

•	We decided that since I am already at the Museum on Friday that on my Lunch, I could take more of the photos that we would need to continue this process, Chloe offered to some along and help for speed’s sake.

•	Finally, we decided that Tropy is not integral to our process and, but we can use it as a dumping site for the images that we run through Azure, to keep organized.
